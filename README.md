# Cybera's Hubot - Huey

Recently we moved to [slack.com's](http://slack.com) real time messaging service. This was good opportunity to bring in Hubot. Slack provides a Hubot integration, as well as a Hubot adapter for Slack, so using Heroku it only took maybe a couple of hours to get our bot up and running and listening on Slack channels. Of course Hubot works with several other messaging systems, such as Campfire and Hipchat.
